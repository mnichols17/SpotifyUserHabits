# SpotifyUserHabits

#### Allows Spotify users to view the songs/artists they listen the most to

- Uses the [Spotify Web API](https://spotify-habits.herokuapp.com) to access a user's profile picture, username 
and their listening habits.

- A React front-end makes requests to an Express back-end to send and receive data from the Spotify Web API.
